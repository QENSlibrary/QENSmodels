Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome from the community. 
Questions can be asked on the issues page. 
Before creating a new issue, please take a moment to search and make sure a 
similar issue does not already exist. If one does exist, you can comment 
(most simply even with just a :+1:) to show your support for that issue.

If you have direct contributions you would like considered for incorporation 
into the project you can fork this repository and submit a pull request for review.

Contributed models should be written in `Python` (compatibility with python 3.x 
is preferred).

You need to upload the `Python` source code files to the 
[git repository](https://github.com/QENSlibrary/QENSmodels)
