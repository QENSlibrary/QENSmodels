# Introduction

*QENSlibrary* is a repository containing models (mathematical functions) that
can be used to fit Quasi Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) data.  
This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon
2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 654000.

# Installation
Support [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7 and 3.6

## Requirements

Python modules to use the models:
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)  

Additional modules are required to run the examples. Details can be
found in the README file of the *examples* folder.

## How to install?

# Documentation
The documentation is built using `Sphinx`. The required packages can be
installed using the following commands:

```
pip install sphinx
pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleon
pip install m2r
```

Other ways of installing `Sphinx` at be found at
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/install.html#


## How to build documentation?

In a terminal, move to the *docs* folder and type

   `make html`

This command will generate html files in the subfolder *_build/html*.

# Tests
The script to run the doctests is located in the `tools` folder.  
In a terminal, move to the `tools` directory and run
```
./run_doctest.sh
```

## How to use?

```python
import QENSmodels
value = QENSmodels.lorentzian(1, 1, 1, 1)

```
or copy and paste the script related to the Lorentzian function.  
The scripts can be found in the 
[git repository](https://github.com/QENSlibrary/QENSmodels)

Jupyter notebooks using some of the QENS models are located in the `examples` 
folder. The name of the notebook indicates which fitting engine and QENS model 
are used. Additional tools might have to be installed in order to use a 
particular notebook.
